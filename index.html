        <p>Hi everyone! I'm Neha, and I'm a junior at the University of Michigan. I've always felt like so many of my core memories revolve around cooking and eating - so much so I wrote my college essay about Thai basil fried rice. While my host of deathly allergies definitely complicates this at times, I've come to appreciate the increasing public awareness of allergies and intolerances. While eating out as a kid used to be a nightmare, I've been able to reliably source allergen information and broaden my horizons in recent years.  <p>
        <p>I'll be hopping on here to share some of my favorite food-centered memories, extensive scientifically-backed A2 boba ratings and longtime favorite recipes.<p>
